## Digital Electronics at California College of the Arts, Spring 2020

### Syllabus

* Title: IxD Foundations: Digital Electronics - DESGN-625-1
* Class: Friday 8:00am - 11:00am, Room 107 SF Main (SF Hybrid Lab)
* Instructor: Dr. Sudhu Tewari <stewari@cca.edu>
* Office hours:
	* Friday 11:00am - 12:00pm
	* at other times by appointment

#### Goals
The goal of this class is to teach you how to design, build, and debug digital electronic devices. My goal is to make the course as interesting and relevant as possible for you, so please ask questions and bring up topics you are curious about.

#### Learning Outcomes:
- learn the basics of designing, building, and debugging digital electronic devices.
- learn elementary concepts of physical computing
- research through making and prototyping
- work through versioning
- understand and respond to technology constraints
- start to make connections between technology, programming, and outcome goals

#### Github and Class Repository
We will be using a cloud service called Github. Our repository is at https://github.com/loopstick/CCA_DigitalElectronics_Spring2020

The class repository will be used to assign homework and reading assignments, and will contain useful code, libraries, and links to other resources. Github allows you to receive email updates when a repository changes — take advantage of this feature!

You will be required to create your own repository for handing in homework and for project documentation.

#### Required Textbook
No textbook is required, but there are many good online references and a few good books out there I can recommend. We also have a good assortment of books in the library.

#### Prerequisites
* Basic algebra. You should be comfortable with simple equations, manipulating numbers, fractions, solving for variables, and the engineering prefixes (micro, milli, kilo, mega, etc.)

#### Requirements and Expectations
* Always bring your computer to class. If you don’t have a computer, check one out from the Media Center. You will need a computer to participate, and your grade will be negatively affected if you don’t bring one.
* Always bring your Arduino, breadboard, jumper wires, sensors, etc. to class.
* I recommend keeping a dedicated notebook for this class. Keep your project sketches, schematics, punch lists, and class notes in this notebook. You can also scan your notes, sketches, etc and post them in your GitHub repository.
* Participate in class! Ask questions, guess answers, propose topics, share interesting projects you’ve found, push the envelope, explore your interests, and teach us all! There are no stupid questions; admitting when you don’t know something should be a point of pride. Chances are you’re not the only one with a question, just the bravest one.
* As outlined in the CCA Student Handbook, attendance in class is mandatory. Three or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade.
* Plan to spend 3-12 hours a week on homework. Plan ahead!
* Submit your homework on time.  Organize your GitHub repository to be easy to navigate. Attend class, and don’t be late. These are not requests, these are requirements.
* You are responsible for checking your email and the class repository for updates.

#### Access & Wellness Services
CCA says:
> Students with disabilities, including disabilities that are not clearly evident like chronic diseases or learning disabilities are
encouraged to notify their instructor after class or during office hours. CCA will make reasonable accommodations for persons with > documented disabilities. Students should contact Suzanne Raffeld, Director of Access and Wellness Services (email: sraffeld@cca.edu; phone: 510.594.3775), to answer any questions or for assistance. For more information, consult CCA's webpage at: http://www.cca.edu/students/resources/disability.

**I want you to succeed in this class!** Please make use of the Hybrid Lab coaches, the Learning Resource Center, and talk to me if you feel you are struggling with the material — I can help you do better in this class, but only if you let me know you need help.

#### Class Format
Sessions will be a mix of lectures, guided labs, and independent work time.
Homework will require research, analysis, and experimentation.
Engineering always takes more time than you think — please make sure to give yourself enough time!

#### Grading
I will consider the various components of the class in roughly the following proportions:
* 25% Homework & Assignments
* 40% Projects and Project Documentation
* 25% In-Class Hands-on Work and Notebook
* 10% Attendance & Participation

#### Grading Rubric

**A: Excellent.** You’ve exhibited exemplary conceptual, technical and
perceptual ability implementing projects. You’ve demonstrated a deft
understanding of required readings, and ability to successfully
communicate ideas and processes to others. All work is commented and
clearly demonstrates understanding of each lesson.

**B: Good.** You’ve completed assignments, and demonstrated a grasp of
most of the main aspects of each lesson, but not all. You’re able to
communicate information, and step by step processes well. In projects,
conceptual, perceptual, and technical skills are present.

**C: Satisfactory.** You’ve completed the assignments but may lack
enthusiasm or drive to push the work into detailed display of
comprehension. You have not demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of
the application or programming environment.

**D: Unsatisfactory.** You have not completed the work as assigned.
Substantial problems exist in your work.

**F: Fail.** You did not submit work, or work is below unsatisfactory level.


#### Words of Advice
Exploration is a key part of this class. You’ll get more out of your work if you give yourself extra time and have patience. Sometimes you’ll hit a dead end and have to start over — don’t despair, it happens to everyone, but give yourself extra time just in case.
This class should be both fun and intense. It’s most fun when you enjoy what you’re working on, so make a point of taking some time to explore projects you make want to work on in the future!


#### Required equipment
- _Arduino Uno R3__ e.g. from
	[Arduino](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/a000066) or
	[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) or
	[Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/A000066-Arduino-Arduino-Uno-R3-DIP-Edition-Revision-3-_2151486.html) or [Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBZ4CII/3) via
	[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GRTSV6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AA57DDZKZUZDL&psc=1).
    - Not recommended: Arduino compatibles, especially those from untested sources. Some sellers on Amazon or Ebay are selling cut-rate knock offs that _sometimes_ work and sometimes _do not_.
    - Also not recommended: [Adafruit Metro - Uno compatible](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50). Although Adafruit is typically a great source, the Metro FTDI drivers are less than simple and straightforward to get working and keep working consistently.

- _Solderless breadboard_, full size (also known as 830 tie point) e.g. from
	[Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?search_type=jamecoall&catalogId=10001&freeText=2157706&langId=-1&productId=2157706&storeId=10001&ddkey=http:StoreCatalogDrillDownView) or [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239)

- Full size _USB cable_ (type A to type B) e.g. from [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/10U2-02203-BK-Cable-USB2-0-A-B-3-Feet-Black-USB-A-Male-To-USB-B-Male_222608.html) or [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/62)

- Pack of _jumper wires_ e.g. from [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/MKSEEED3-65-Piece-Reinforced-Jumper-Wire-Set_2229191.html) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Solderless-Flexible-Breadboard-Jumper-Arduino/dp/B00ARTWJ44/ref=pd_lpo_328_lp_t_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=N9HAJ64FXQ5JZV55JGX3) or [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/759)

- _Output_ devices for your projects: LEDs, speakers, motors, etc.

- _Sensors_ for your project

- _Laptop_ (Windows, Linux, or Macintosh)

Many vendors grant discounts for educational purposes so ask before you purchase. I encourage you to organize a group purchase to save on shipping fees, but do so immediately so you have the equipment on hand.
 - The code ADAEDU may be good for 10% educational discount at Adafruit.  
 - Mentioning that you are a student of mine may get you a discount at Al Lasher’s.

Local stores that should carry all these are:
* [Jameco](http://www.jameco.com) in Belmont, just south of the SFO airport. Order online and pick up same day.
* [Al Lasher's Electronics](http://allashers.com/) in Berkeley
* [Fry's Electronics](http://www.frys.com) (various locations in South Bay) has some electronic supplies


#### Optional equipment
As you develop your projects and interests, you might need to purchase additional components and devices. This is impossible to predict as the range of projects you might approach are indeed infinite. At the low end, you can build amazing projects from discarded electronic devices such as printers at absolutely no cost; at the high end there is no limit; a complicated robotic project could easily start at hundreds of dollars.

#### Some lessons I’ve learned:
- Projects will cost more than you think they will
- Projects will take longer than you think they will
- You will order parts that are wrong or that you simply decide not to use. Be ready to accept this. Consider these items you might
trade with other students (or the larger maker community) for parts that you do need, especially when you need that part urgently.
- You will spend less time and money if you are flexible about your concept. Allow prototype iterations to modify your concept, not just your execution. The reverse is also true: If you strongly want to stick to your concept, be prepared to spend more time and money. The common way of looking at this is to consider that there is a relationship between time, money, and features. You can choose any two of them, and the third will grow (or shrink) to accommodate.

      - First try to figure it out on your own.
        - Google is great here.
      - Upload your code to Github (or email it)
        - remember that Arduino .ino files must live in a folder of the same name along with any other associated files, so zips work well to keep everything together
        - The file/folder name should make sense (i.e. _"Sudhu_MidtermProj_v3"_ vs _"file_012619"_)
      - Explain the problem to me (or whoever you are asking)

- *Homework*
	- Build a mock-up of a simplified version of your _device that does something_ (previously: musical instrument)
		- You may modify your proposal to make use of anything new you've learned
		- Appearance does not matter
		- Function matters supremely!
		- use two sensors
		- use two types of output
		- The main goal is to test the feasibility of your plan, so your mock-up
			must show that. If you plan to measure a heartbeat, show that you can do
			that. If you plan to detect a footstop, show that you can do that. If
			you plan to create a complex sound like a tabla, show that you can do
			that.
		- As always
			- Email me if you have questions
			- Make a new folder on your Github repository for this project
				- Put your code in that folder. Call it something like _"YourName_firstMockUp"_
				- Put a schematic in that folder.
				  - Hand drawn is fine.
				  - [fritzing](http:fritzing.org) and [circuit.io](https://www.circuito.io/)
				  are also nice for creating schematics.
